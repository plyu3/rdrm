This can solve the problem B in mcm 2019. Given the (drone_speed, drone_flighttime, drone_payload, ..) find the best 
route.

This file use improved Dijkstra Algorithm to solve the problem of 
determine the best route with different type of drones given the location of container box and cities need visit.

it will return the type of drone to choose for each flight.
